# library_management_system
The Library Management System is a simple console-based application developed in C++ that allows users to manage a collection of books in a library. It provides functionalities to add new books, check out books, return books, and display available books. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including classes, objects, and encapsulation.

Features
Add Books: Add new books to the library with title and author information.
Display Available Books: View a list of all books currently available for checkout.
Check Out Books: Check out a book if it is available.
Return Books: Return a book that has been checked out.
Basic Error Handling: Inform users if a book is not available for checkout or if they attempt to return a book that was not checked out.
